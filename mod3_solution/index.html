    <div class="row">Chicken
      <div id="chic" class="col-xs-12">Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
<br><br>
Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.

    <div class="row">Beef
      <div id="beef" class="col-xs-12">Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are improved by aging; in one common aging method the carcass is hung for about two weeks at approximately 36 °F (2 °C), encouraging physical changes in the muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.

    <div class="row">Sushi
      <div id="sushi" class="col-xs-12"> Sushi is actually a way to prepare rice, not raw fish with accompaniment ... In fact, sushi always carries rice but it does not have to carry fish.
<br><br>
Sushi is the most famous Japanese dish outside of Japan and one of the most popular among Japanese, who enjoy sushi on special occasions.  And as such, it was evolved outside that country, influenced by different Western cultures, especially in USA. That is why many of the different types of sushi have denomination of localities of USA (California roll, New York roll, etc.)
<br><br>
The name of sushi is a generic name of different types, combinations of ingredients and forms of a typical Japanese food, and basically are made from Japanese type rice and different seafood (fresh fish, prawns, seaweed etc) and vegetables.
